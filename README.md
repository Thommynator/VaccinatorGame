# Vaccinator Game

## Disclaimer
_The game is currently in a prototype state. A lot of game mechanics, UI elements and sounds are missing. Graphics are placeholders and are going to be replaced soon._

## Game Idea
You're playing as an antibody and have to **protect some cells against attacking viruses**. 
Your view radius is limited, i.e. you constantly have to move around and check for attacking viruses. 
Your viewradius will get even smaller over time and you have to kill viruses to increase it again.
The catch: If one of your cell gets _infected_ it starts to produce even more viruses, which will make your life signifintly harder.

For each kill you will be rewarded with money. 
This can be used to buy upgrades, e.g. to make your cells more resistent, make your own attacks stronger, reduce attack cooldowns, ... you name it. 
You will need them, because the viruses will also get stronger over time and they will appear in shorter intervals. Choose wisely!

### Goal
Keep your cells alive as long as possible. The **game** is **over** when all of your cells are infected.
